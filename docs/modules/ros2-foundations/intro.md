# ROS2 Foundations

## Overview

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the fundamental framework for building robotic applications. You'll learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions - the core communication patterns that enable robots to function as integrated systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 and its architecture
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Work with services and actions for more complex interactions
- Debug common ROS 2 issues and troubleshoot effectively

## Module Structure

1. [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter-1-intro-ros2.md) - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes](./chapter-2-ros2-nodes.md) - Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
3. [Chapter 3: ROS 2 Actions](./chapter-3-ros2-actions.md) - Implement long-running tasks with feedback
4. [Basic ROS 2 Tutorial Steps](./basic-ros2-tutorial-steps.md) - Hands-on tutorial with step-by-step instructions
5. [ROS 2 Troubleshooting Guide](./ros2-troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installed with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Understanding of basic Linux command line operations

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter-1-intro-ros2.md) to understand the foundational concepts before moving on to the hands-on tutorials.
