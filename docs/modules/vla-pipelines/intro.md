# VLA Pipelines: Vision-Language-Action Systems

## Overview

This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines that integrate computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action execution. You'll learn how to create complete systems that process natural language commands, analyze visual input, and execute corresponding robotic actions in a cohesive pipeline.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate Whisper speech recognition with ROS 2 systems
- Connect GPT models for natural language understanding in robotics
- Create complete VLA workflows combining vision, language, and action
- Build voice-controlled robotic systems with visual context awareness
- Implement multimodal fusion for enhanced robotic decision-making

## Module Structure

1. [Chapter 1: Whisper Integration](./chapter-1-whisper-integration/index.md) - Speech recognition and voice command processing
2. [Chapter 2: GPT-ROS Bridge](./chapter-2-gpt-ros-bridge/index.md) - Natural language understanding and command interpretation
3. [Chapter 3: VLA Workflows](./chapter-3-vla-workflows/index.md) - Complete Vision-Language-Action pipeline implementation
4. [VLA Pipeline Tutorial](./vla-pipeline-tutorial.md) - Hands-on implementation guide
5. [VLA Troubleshooting Guide](./vla-troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
6. [VLA Validation Notes](./vla-validation-notes.md) - Compatibility and validation information

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Experience with ROS 2 (covered in ROS2 Foundations module)
- Understanding of basic computer vision concepts
- Python programming skills
- An OpenAI API key for GPT integration
- Microphone and camera for voice and visual input

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Whisper Integration](./chapter-1-whisper-integration/index.md) to understand how to set up speech recognition in your robotic systems before moving on to the more advanced VLA integration topics.
