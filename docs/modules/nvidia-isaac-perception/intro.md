# NVIDIA Isaac Perception

## Overview

This module covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotic perception, focusing on high-fidelity simulation for developing, testing, and validating perception systems before deploying to real hardware. You'll learn about photorealistic rendering, sensor simulation, and synthetic data generation for AI perception tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Isaac Sim for perception tasks
- Implement VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems
- Develop manipulation systems with perception feedback
- Generate synthetic training data using Isaac Sim
- Integrate perception systems with ROS 2

## Module Structure

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Basics](./chapter-1-isaac-basics.md) - Introduction to Isaac Sim architecture and setup
2. [Chapter 2: VSLAM](./chapter-2-vslam.md) - Visual SLAM implementation and validation
3. [Chapter 3: Manipulation](./chapter-3-manipulation.md) - Perception-driven manipulation systems
4. [Isaac Sim Tutorial Steps](./isaac-sim-tutorial-steps.md) - Hands-on setup and implementation guide
5. [Isaac Troubleshooting Guide](./isaac-troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
6. [Isaac Validation Notes](./isaac-validation-notes.md) - Compatibility and validation information

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Experience with ROS 2 (covered in ROS2 Foundations module)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Isaac Sim 4.x installed
- An NVIDIA GPU with RTX architecture (recommended) or CUDA-compatible GPU
- Understanding of computer vision concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Basics](./chapter-1-isaac-basics.md) to understand the fundamental concepts before moving on to the more advanced perception and manipulation topics.
