# Digital Twin Simulation: Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2 Integration

## Overview

This module covers digital twin simulation systems that integrate Gazebo, Unity-style environments, and ROS 2 for comprehensive robotics simulation. You'll learn how to create sophisticated simulation environments that can be used for education, research, and development of complex robotic applications using multiple simulation platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for robotics
- Create Unity-style high-fidelity simulation experiences
- Integrate multiple simulation platforms with ROS 2
- Implement advanced sensor simulation and perception systems
- Build comprehensive digital twin systems for educational purposes
- Validate simulation results and ensure accuracy
