# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

Welcome to the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Curriculum! This comprehensive guide teaches students how to bridge AI models with physical robots, specifically humanoids.

## Overview

This curriculum covers:

- **ROS2 Foundations**: Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 for robot control
- **Digital Twin Simulation**: Master physics simulation with Gazebo and Unity
- **NVIDIA Isaac Perception**: Understand perception, VSLAM, and manipulation
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Pipelines**: Build systems that process natural language commands

## Target Audience

- Students in advanced AI/robotics programs
- Robotics engineers transitioning into embodied AI
- Developers learning ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and VLA
- Educators building curriculum for humanoid robotics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [ROS2 Foundations](./modules/ros2-foundations/intro.md) module to learn the basics of robot operating system programming.
